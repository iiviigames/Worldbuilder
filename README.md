## 🌍 What is Worldbuilder?

After finding [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) in mid 2022, I found the answer to literal years of struggling as a writer. I'd built custom engines in the past for the purpose of just writing how I want - and Obsidian made me not just a better writer, but a **paid writer**. The point is this:

> Once I had the tools I needed, I was able to thrive.

Obsidian is chock full of tools - but there's one thing in my creative writing life that I've never found the right thing for (besides stacks of notebooks...)

**WORLDBUILDING!**

Worldbuilder will be a **_FREE_** tool, taking the base excellence of Obsidian, and introducing numerous other design choices and schools of organization, I will combine it all into a playground for the imagination. The road to completion is long - and I'd encourage you NOT to even download this until further notice.
